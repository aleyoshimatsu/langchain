The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997. The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998. In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work. These various attempts were not successful: Chaum\\'s concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008–2009: Creation ===\\n\\nThe domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto\\'s identity remains unknown. All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature. Nakamoto\\'s innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain. Nakamoto\\'s paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work.\\nOn 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in this block was the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\", which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper. Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters. On May 22, 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John\\'s pizzas for ₿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2010–2012: Early growth ===\\nBlockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen.

Mining packages groups of transactions into blocks, and produces a hash code that follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Creating this hash requires expensive energy, but a network node can verify the hash is valid using very little energy. If a miner proposes a block to the network, and its hash is valid, the block and its ledger changes are added to the blockchain, and the network moves on to yet unprocessed transactions. In case there is a dispute, then the longest chain is considered to be correct. A new block is created every 10 minutes, on average.\\nChanges to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus among the network participants. The Bitcoin protocol has inspired the creation of numerous other digital currencies and blockchain-based technologies, making it a foundational technology in the field of cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n\\n== Blockchain ==\\n\\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized and secure digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It ensures transparency, immutability, and tamper resistance, making data manipulation difficult. Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and has applications beyond finance, such as supply chain management and smart contracts.\\n\\n\\n=== Transactions ===\\n\\nThe network requires minimal structure to share transactions.  An ad hoc decentralized network of volunteers is sufficient. Messages are broadcast on a best-effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon reconnection, a node downloads and verifies new blocks from other nodes to complete its local copy of the blockchain.\\n\\n\\n== Mining ==\\n\\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work system or  a proof-or-transaction to form a distributed timestamp server as a peer-to-peer network. This work is often called bitcoin mining. During mining, practically all of the computing power of the Bitcoin network is used to solve cryptographic tasks, which is proof of work. Their purpose is to ensure that the generation of valid blocks involves a certain amount of effort so that subsequent modification of the blockchain, such as in the 51% attack scenario, can be practically ruled out. Because of the difficulty, miners form \"mining pools\" to get payouts despite these high power requirements, costly hardware deployments, and hardware under control. As a result of the Chinese ban on Bitcoin mining in 2021, the United States currently holds the largest share of Bitcoin mining pools.\\nRequiring a proof of work to accept a new block to the blockchain was Satoshi Nakamoto\\'s key innovation. The mining process involves identifying a block that, when hashed twice with SHA-256, yields a number smaller than the given difficulty target. While the average work required increases in inverse proportion to the difficulty target, a hash can always be verified by executing a single round of double SHA-256.\\nFor the bitcoin timestamp network, a valid proof of work is found by incrementing a nonce until a value is found that gives the block\\'s hash the required number of leading zero bits.
